# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS GAME

###

I created a Rock Paper Scissors game with the HTML,CSS and JavaScript Stack.
I created a dropdown menu for the user to select what sign do they want to use out of (RPS).I created a button that not only generates an opponent/computer sign of RPS but it also compares with the users sign selected through the dropdown menu to see who won the rock paper scissors contest. The winner is abruptlys shown below underneath the button

The processing of the winner was established through javascript functionality through the addEventListener method and the results() function.
