# Library management system

###

Create a library management system where users can add, remove, and borrow books. Implement classes for books, users, and the library itself. Use inheritance to represent different types of books (e.g., fiction, non-fiction) and encapsulation to control access to book data.

I created a project that implements class called ..Book. that has a plethora of methods and variables... to be used. Different types of functionality such as addBook,removeBook and borrowBook methods.
